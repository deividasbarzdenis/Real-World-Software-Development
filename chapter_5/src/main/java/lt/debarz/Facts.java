/**
 * We need to encapsulate the state that is available to actions
 * within the Business Rules Engine. Let’s model these requirements by introducing a
 * new class called Facts, which will represent the state available as part of the
 * Business Rules Engine, and an updated Action interface that can operate on facts.
 * An updated unit test is shown in Example 5-9. The unit test checks that when the
 * Business Rules Engine runs, the specified action is actually invoked with the Facts
 * object passed as an argument.
