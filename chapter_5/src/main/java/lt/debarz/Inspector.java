/**
 * This general idea is the foundation of the Interface Segregation Principle. It makes
 * the case that no class should be forced to depend on methods it does not use because
 * this introduces unnecessary coupling. In Chapter 2, you learned about another
 * principle, the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), which promotes high cohesion.
 * The SRP is a general design guideline that a class has responsibility over a single
 * functionality and there should be only one reason for it to change. Although the ISP
 * may sound like the same idea, it takes a different view. The ISP focuses on the user
 * of an interface rather than its design. In other words, if an interface ends up very
 * large, it may be that the user of that interface sees some behaviors it doesnâ€™t care for,
 * which causes unnecessary coupling.
