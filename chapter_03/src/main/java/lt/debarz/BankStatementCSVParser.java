* The first natural step is to extract the CSV parsing logic into aseparate class so you can reuse it for different
* processing queries.Letâ€™s call it BankStatementCSVParser so it is immediately clear what it does (Example 2-3).
* the class BankStatementCSVParser declares two methods, parseFromCSV() and parseLinesFromCSV(),
* that generate BankTransaction objects, which is a domain class  that models a bank statement
* */

/*
* BankStatementCSVParser will now become an implementation of that interface
* but how do you decouple the BankStatementAnalyzer from the specific implementation of a
* BankStatementCSVParser? You need to use the interface! By introducing a new method called analyze(), which takes
* BankTransactionParser as an argument, you are no longer coupled to a specific implementation

* The key benefit with this refactoring is that your main application is
no longer responsible for the implementation of the parsing logic. It
is now delegating that responsibility to a separate class and methods
that can be maintained and updated independently. As new
requirements come in for different queries, you can reuse the
functionality encapsulated by the BankStatementCSVParser
class.
